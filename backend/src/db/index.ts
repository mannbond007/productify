// 👀 What is a Connection Pool?
// A connection pool is a cache of database connections that are kept open and reused.

// 🤷‍♂️ Why use it?
// 🔴 Opening/closing connections is slow. Instead of creating a new connection for each request, we reuse existing ones.
// 🔴 Databases limit concurrent connections. A pool manages a fixed number of connections and shares them across requests.
